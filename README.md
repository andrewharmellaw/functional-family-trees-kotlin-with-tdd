# Functional Family Trees (with Tests!)

(Based on [exercises](https://github.com/scala-exercises/exercises-fpinscala/blob/main/src/main/scala/fpinscalalib/FunctionalDataStructuresSection.scala) in chapter three of [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason.)

In functional programming there are some core constructs which you'll bumping into - either directly (they keep popping up) or indirectly (you uncover them when you lift the lid on something else).  I've found it super-useful to keep a visual track of the hierarchies of these ur-elements, referring to it whenever I wanted to lash some current concept back to something simpler and more concrete. It helps me ensure I'm building my new, functional mental models on something solid.

Here's the hierarchy I've built up so far:

## foldLeft:
foldLeft underpins everything. I blogged about it in depth in my ["Slow Boat to Folding"])(https://scalaeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-slow-boat-to-folding.html) post on [my scala blog](https://scalaeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/). For our purposes here, we can state a few facts.

foldLeft:
- takes an algebraic data structure (DEFINITION) and a bi-arg function (DEFINIITON) with a seed value, and applies the function to each element in the datastructure, associating from the left hand end
- produces an new accumulated output value with the same type as the seed value
- use when ...
- implemented in terms of case / match
- can be implemented in a tail recursive (stack-safe) fashion
    - e.g.

## reverse:

- takes a collection, and ...
- use when ...
- implemented in terms of foldLeft, with a seed value of an empty collection of the same type as the input collection and a function which puts the current value as the head of the accumulator '((acc, head) => Cons(head, acc))'
    - e.g. def reverse[A](l: List[A]): List[A] = foldLeft(l, List[A]())((acc, head) => Cons(head ,acc))

## foldRight:
- takes an algebraic data structure and a bi-arg function with a seed value, and applies the function to each element in the data-structure, associating from the right hand end
- produces an new accumulated output value with the same type as the seed value
- use when ...
- can be implemented in terms of case / match but this isn't stack safe as it's not tail-recursive
- can be also be implemented in terms of foldLeft which means it can be stack safe
    - e.g.

##  append:
- takes two collections ...
- use when ...
- implemented in terms of foldRight, and simply replaces the `Nil` constructor of the first list with the second list
    - e.g. def append[A](l: List[A], r: List[A]): List[A] = foldRight(l, r)(Cons(_,_))

## concat:
- takes a collection, ...
- use when ...
- implemented in terms of foldRight, and append
    - e.g. def concat[A](l: List[List[A]]): List[A] = foldRight(l, Nil:List[A])(append)

## map:
- takes an algebraic data structure and a uni-arg function, and applies the function to each element in the datastructure.
- produces a new output value with the same type as the input algebraic data structure
- contained value type is determined by the supplied uni-arg function
- use when ...
- typically implemented in terms of foldLeft (or foldRight)
    - seed value is an empty algebraic data type with the same type as the input algebraic data structure
    - e.g. def map[A,B](l: List[A])(f: A => B): List[B] = foldRight(l, Nil:List[B])((h,t) => Cons(f(h),t))

## sum:
- takes a collection, summing each value in turn to produce a result
- use when ...
- implemented in terms of foldLeft, with a seed value of '0' / '0.0' and a bi-arg function '_ + _'
    - e.g. def sum(l: List[Int]) = foldLeft(l, 0)(_ + _)

## product:
- takes a collection, multiplying each value in turn to produce a result
- use when ...
- implemented in terms of foldLeft, with a seed value of '1' / '1.0' and a bi-arg function '_ * _'
    - e.g. def product(l: List[Double]) = foldLeft(l, 1.0)(_ * _)

## length:
- takes a collection, and increments a counter by one for each element to produce a result
- use when ...
- implemented in terms of foldLeft, with a seed value of '0' and a uni-arg incrementing function '(acc, head) => acc + 1'
    - e.g. def length[A](l: List[A]): Int = foldLeft(l, 0)((acc,h) => acc + 1)

## flatMap:
- takes a collection of collections, and ...
- use when ...
- implemented in terms of concat and map, with ...
    - e.g. def flatMap[A,B](l: List[A])(f: A => List[B]): List[B] = concat(map(l)(f))

## filter:
- takes a collection and ...
- use when ...
- implemented in terms of foldLeft with ...
    - e.g. def filter[A](l: List[A])(f: A => Boolean): List[A] = foldRight(l, Nil:List[A])((h,t) => if (f(h)) Cons(h,t) else t)  **** NOTE THIS EXAMPLE IS FOLDRIGHT!!! ****

## zipWith:
- takes ...
- produces ...
- use when ...
- can be implemented in terms of case / match
    - e.g.
